This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot application that uses Elasticsearch for information retrieval and OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses. The application is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- An Elasticsearch cluster
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-chatbot.git
   cd rag-chatbot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

For macOS users, please refer to the [macOS Python Installation Guide](#macos-python-installation-guide) below.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the provided `.env.example` file. Here's an explanation of each environment variable:

- `CLOUD_ID`: Your Elasticsearch Cloud ID
- `API_KEY`: Your Elasticsearch API key
- `ELASTIC_URL`: The URL of your Elasticsearch instance
- `LLM_TYPE`: The type of language model to use (currently only supports 'openai')
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `INDEX_NAME`: The name of the Elasticsearch index to search
- `TITLE`: The preferred named of the application or the project
- `LOGO_PATH`: Path to the logo file for the application (optional)
- `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FILE`: Path to the prompt template file (optional)
- `ELSER_MODEL`: The name of the ELSER model to use for Elasticsearch (default: ".elser_model_2_linux-x86_64")

Example `.env` file:

```
CLOUD_ID=your-cloud-id
API_KEY=your-api-key
ELASTIC_URL=https://your-elasticsearch-url
LLM_TYPE=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
INDEX_NAME=your-index-name
LOGO_PATH=artefacts/your-logo.png
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FILE=artefacts/prompt_template.txt
ELSER_MODEL=".elser_model_2_linux-x86_64"
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
streamlit run rag-application.py
```

For debugging purposes, you can enable debug mode by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```
DEBUG=true streamlit run rag-application.py
```

This will provide additional logging information in the console and the Streamlit interface.

## Usage

1. Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Enter your question in the input field.
3. The application will retrieve relevant information from Elasticsearch and generate a response using the OpenAI model.
4. The response will be displayed along with cited references.

## Customization

- To customize the prompt template, edit the file specified in `PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FILE`.
- To change the application logo, update the `LOGO_PATH` in the `.env` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for your Elasticsearch cluster and OpenAI API key.
3. Run the application in debug mode to get more detailed logging information.

## macOS Python Installation Guide

### 1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software. Open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### 2. Install Python

We'll use Homebrew to install Python. In Terminal, run:

```bash
brew install python
```

This will install the latest version of Python 3.

### 3. Verify Python Installation

Check that Python is installed correctly:

```bash
python3 --version
```

This should display the installed Python version.

### 4. Set up a Virtual Environment

#### a. Navigate to Your Project Directory

In Terminal, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

#### b. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment in your project directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### c. Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install Required Packages

With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 7. Using the Virtual Environment

Every time you want to work on your project, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
source venv/bin/activate
```
